# ExpHP's Touhou pages

::title[]

On this site you'll find some resources for modding Touhou, most notably for ANM scripting.

New to ANM?  See [What's this all about?](#/anm/concepts&a=why-anm)

Otherwise, you're probably looking for this: [ANM Instruction Reference](#anm/ins)

## About

The information on this site is the culmination of several pretty deep dives into the lowest level parts of the rendering code in the Touhou games, with the goal being to fill in the many little gaps in our knowledge; all those instructions that didn't seem to do anything (or did *Peculiar, Unexplainable Things™*) when tested; all those dozens of bitflags with unknown purpose.  This work was done on the shoulders of giants, and could not have been possible without:

* The [ANM docs on thwiki](https://thwiki.cc/脚本对照表/ANM), the largest pre-existing body of knowledge on ANM
* Those on Discord helping me make sense of some of my craziest discoveries: dass, Dai, Priw8, Riri, zero318, 32th system.
* The maintainers of thtk and thcrap for creating these amazing tools.

My efforts have slowed down quite a bit as I've stopped to put together this site, but hopefully one day we can push that documented instruction count to 100%!

Be sure to check out [Priw8's site](https://priw8.github.io) as a companion for ECL.
